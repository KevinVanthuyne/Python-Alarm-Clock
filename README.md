# Python Alarm Clock
A **Python 3** & **PHP** powered alarm clock running on a Raspberry Pi 3 that wakes you up with a random selection of nature sounds.
Wake up gently as the alarm slowly adds different layers of sounds. One time the alarm goes off with a small creek flowing and some birds chirping. Another time it plays the waves of the sea and seagulls.
