# Python Alarm Clock
A **Python 3** & **PHP** powered alarm clock that wakes you up with a random selection of nature sounds.
Wake up gently as the alarm slowly adds different layers of sounds. One time the alarm goes off with a small creek flowing and some birds chirping. Another time it plays the waves of the sea and seagulls.

## Features
- Random selection of sounds everytime the alarm goes off
- Web interface to set and cancel alarm
- Choose & organize your own sounds
- Blacklist folders so they don't play as the first sound
- Choose fade-in length of sounds
